* Arduino Board
* 1088AS matrix
* 1 104 pF ceramic capacitor
* 1 10 ÂµF electrolitic capacitor
* 4 buttons
* LCD Display (optional)
You can find detailed instruction for the setup in the Wiki of this project!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## How to play
If you ever played tetris in your life than you should be good.ðŸ˜†

The setup has 4 buttons the first 3 control the movement of the current piece (left = goes left, middle = rotates the piece, right = goes right) and the 4th one has the purpose of making the piece fall quicker.

The game has 3 difficulties(easy, medium, hard) you can choose the difficulty at the start of the game, these denote the speed at which the pieces will fall. The harder the level, the quicker the piece will fall.

The score is based on how many complete rows you made, for one complete row you will be rewarded 10 points.

Have fun! ðŸŽ®
